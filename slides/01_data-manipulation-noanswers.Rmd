### üí¨ A Note on AI Tools

You‚Äôll soon see that tools like ChatGPT  
can be **incredibly helpful** for learning R.

But **today**, we‚Äôre focusing on **foundations** ‚Äî  
how to read code, write it, and think through problems.


 ‚è≥**For Today**

> **Please don‚Äôt use AI during this session.**  
> Let your brain do the debugging !

Why?

-  Struggling helps you learn  
-  You‚Äôre building foundations that will make AI more useful later  
- Ô∏è We‚Äôll talk about AI **at the end of class**

üß≠**What to Do Instead**
- Use the documentation in R
- Read error messages carefully  
- Ask a neighbor or raise your hand

### SOURCE
.nunito[You'll spend most of you time here!] Where you write and save code  
--
(File > New File > R Script) 
üìå **First thing:** Save your script! 
--

- An `#` allows to comment your code. Everything after it is ignored until a line break
- Separate different commands with a **line break** for clarity. But, note that a space doesn't break a command. 

--
- Run and source buttons send code to the console to be executed 
  - Run (from selection). Highlight the code  ‚Üí `Ctrl + Enter`. If no code is selected it will run the line where the cursor is. 
  - Source (run everything)

--
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
1 + 1 # Equals two?

1 +   # Also equals two? 
  1   # R recognizes that you are not done yet! 
      
1
+ 1   # Equals one. 

```

### CONSOLE
.nunito[The heart of the operation ü´Ä] 

Here is where you communicate with R to get it to do things. 

--
- You write after the `>` prompt. It means that R is ready for a new instruction. Press enter and R will execute the code.
- You can write there directly for quick calculations or fleeting requests you don't need to save. 

--

.greenemph[**WRITE MOST OF YOUR CODE IN THE SOURCE PANEL**]

<br>
<br> 
### ENVIRONMENT
.nunito[Where we keep track of things üñáÔ∏è]

- Data analysis requires manipulating different *objects*: datasets, vectors, functions, etc. Here is where we keep track of them. 

--
- R is an **object-oriented** language. We'll talk about this in a bit. What it means is that we can see everything we are working with and things are only stored when we ask to.

--
- We **assign** a value to an object with `<-` the assignment operator


--
**See what happens in the environment panel when we run this:**
```{r, echo = T, eval = T, results = F}
5 + 1
x <- 5    # Assigning the value 
x
x + 1
x
x <- x + 1 # Assigning a new value 
x 
  
```

### FILES/ PLOTS/ ... PANEL
.nunito[Many helpful things here üóÑÔ∏è]
- Files shows your *working directory*, the default location of any files you read into or save out of R  `getwd()`
  - We'll see more about how to work with directories and R Projects in **Lecture 3**

--
- Plots / Viewer 
- Packages
- Help 
  - Add a `?` in front of any function to get help: `?getwd()` 

---
## OBJECTS AND FUNCTIONS
R revolves around 2 things: **objects and functions** (things and procedures?)

.pull-left[
- **Objects** are vectors, dataframes, regression models. They have attributes. 
<br>
- **Functions** are procedures that typically take one or more objects as arguments (inputs), do something with them and return a new object 

]

.pull-right[


```{r, eval = F}
# This is not R code 
window <- "This is a window"
door <- "This is a door" 
one_hundred <- 100
two_thousand <- 2000
```
```{r, eval = F}
# This is not R code
open(window)
open(door)
open(book)

clean(toilet)
clean(data)
clean(conscience)

```
]

<br>
.center[
.nunito[Programming in R is defining objects and applying functions to those objects ad infinitum]
]

```{r, eval = T}
# This is R code 
grades <- c(15, 10, 12, 13, 18)
mean(grades) 

```
---
## PACKAGES

.nunito[There are **tons** of user-created functions, they come bundled in ***packages***]

- Some functions are built into R itself ‚Äî this is called the **{base}** package.
- Most extra functions live in packages hosted on the **Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)**.

--  
 
 
.nunito[üí° A package is like a lightbulb]

You need to:
- **Install** it once: `install.packages("package_name")`
- **Turn it on** every time you need it: `library(package_name)`

--

**You can also call a function without loading the package**:  
 `package_name::function` <br> **Advantage**: clear for others which package is it coming from, avoids conflicts when packages have functions with the same name. <br> **Disadvantage:** Not practical for functions you use often.

.greenhead[**FILE PATHS, FOLDERS & PROJECTS**]


**üó∫Ô∏è What's a file path?** 

It's like directions to a file on your computer. R needs to know where to find your data. 
- **Absolute** paths:   
`"C:/Users/Maria/Documents/myproject/data/myfile.csv"` Windows
`"/Users/maria/Documents/myproject/data/myfile.csv"` Mac 
- **Relative paths:** `"data/myfile.csv"` 

**üìÅRecommended folder structure** 
```{r, echo = T, eval = F, results = F}

- We are going to analyze the 250 top rated French Movies in IMDB
- Open the CSV file in your computer and inspect it: columns are variables and rows are observations

.nunito[How do we get this data into R?]
- We import it using *read* functions, which take a file path as an input and give the file content as an output. 

üö® Use forward slashes `"mycomputer/folder/file.csv"` instead of backward slashes `"mycomputer\folder\file.csv"`

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, results = F}
imdb <- read.csv("../data/01_imdb-top250-french.csv")

```

```{r, eval = F}
imdb <- read.csv(here("data", "01_imdb-top250-french.csv"))

# Exploring the data 
head(imdb, 4)   # Show first four rows
tail(imdb, 3)   # Show last three rows
View(imdb)      # Show data in a spreadsheet view

### USING FUNCTIONS
- Read the documentation! `?read.csv()`
  - Description
  - Usage 
  - Arguments: with and without default values (you need to write these to work)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Examples 

--
```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"",
         dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...)
```
- You don‚Äôt need to write argument names if you write the arguments in the correct order 

---
<br>
<br>
### SO, WHAT HAPPENED?
.nunito[A common problem when importing data is that the *character encoding* is handled incorrectly. ]

This is when we see weird characters like `√É¬©` where letters should be. 

--

All the characters we see, like `1` ,`#` or `M`, are produced by a sequence of bits (1-0), the encoding determines how these bits are translated into characters. 

--

We need to make sure we are using the right *translation*! 

```{r, eval = F}
imdb <- read.csv(here("data", "01_imdb-top250-french.csv"),
                 encoding = "UTF-8") #UTF-8 should work for latin languages #<< 

```

---
### WHEN THINGS DON'T GO WELL... DEBUGGINGüêû
**Go line by line making sure each command does what you expect it to. **

Most of the time the problem is one of these:

--
- **R isn't ready:** The `>` should appear in the console. There is a `+` instead. You wrote something *incomplete* before and R is waiting for you to finish. Press `ESC`.  <br> ` c(1, 3, `

--
- **Mispelled object or function** Letter reversals or capitalization are often the issue.<br> `maen(1, 2, 3)`, `Mean(1, 2, 3)`

--
- **Punctuation problems** Mixing commas `,` and periods `.` or incorrect use of `" "`. <br>
  `c(1,2.3)`

--
- **Wrong argument** 

--
- **Missing arguments** 
--

### DATA FRAMES AND SUBSETTING
<br>

--
Let's explore the dataset with function `str()`
```{r, echo = T, out.lines = 5}
str(imdb)
```

--

**A dataframe is a collection of vectors.** <br> We use `$` to select a variable of the dataset:
```{r, out.lines = 3}
imdb$Name
```
--
We can also use `$` to create and replace variables
```{r}
imdb$new_var <- c(250:1) # The vector has to be of the same length as the dataframe
```

---
### DATA FRAMES AND SUBSETTING
We can also use the **subsetting** operator `[]` to select a portion of our data. Like this: `data[row, column]` or `vector[element]`. 

--

.pull-left[
We indicate what we want to select using:

- Indices (position) 
  - *The second column*
- Logical operators 
  - *Movies ranked above 10*
- Names: 
  - *Columns "Rank" and "Duration"*
]

.pull-right[
**First row and cols "Name" and "Year": **
```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
imdb[1, c("Name", "Year")]
imdb[1, c(2, 4)]

### EXERCISE
- Create the  vector `c(7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8, 8)` using the function `rep()`

- Modify the code `seq(1, 6)` to get the vector c(0, 2, 4, 6)

- Get the name of the shortest movie in the data set <br>
 üîç Use functions `min()`, `substr()`

- There are 6 movies that last 104 minutes, what are they called?

### MANIPULATING DATA WITH {dplyr}

.nunito[There are tooons of user-created functions, which come in ***packages***]

- So far we‚Äôve only used functions that are already built in R, also known as ****{base}****
    - Packages are centralized on the Comprehensive R Archive Newtork (CRAN)

--
  
  
- An R package is like a lightbulb üí°. <br> First you need to install it `install.packages("package_name")`, <br>and then turn it on when you need it `library("package_name")` 
--
  
  - You can avoid loading the packages by specifying the package `package_name::function` <br> **Advantage**: clear for others which package is it coming from, avoids conflicts when packages have functions with the same name. <br> **Disadvantage:** Not practical for functions you use often.
  
--

- The üåà[tidyverse](tidyverse.org) is an umbrella package that installs several pakages that are useful for data analysis and work well together: {tidyr}, {dplyr}, {ggplot2}, {tibble}, etc. 

    - **{dplyr}**:  data manipulation
    - **{tidyr}**: converting between different shapes

                             TRUE,

```
```{r, echo = F}

```

---
### group_by() AND summarise()
- `group_by()` allows you to do computations separately for different parts of the data 
```{r}
imdb %>% 
  mutate(mean_all = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(audience) %>%   #<< 
  mutate(mean_aud = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(Name, audience, Rating, mean_all, mean_aud) %>% 
  head(5)
```
--

- It will apply to all subsequent operations. You need to `ungroup()` to cancel its effect
```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
imdb %>% 
  group_by(audience) %>%   
  mutate(mean_aud = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%  #<<
  mutate(mean_all = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

---
### group_by() AND summarise()
`group_by()` is also useful with `summarise()`

.pull-left[

  - Keeps the grouping variable 
  - Computes statistics for each group 

```{r}
  imdb %>% 
    group_by(audience) %>% 
    summarise(n = n(),  
              avg_rating = mean(Rating)) 
```

  ]
  
.pull-right[
- `summarise()` by itself computes statistics for the whole dataset
<br> 
<br>
```{r}
  imdb %>% 
    summarise(n = n(),  
              avg_rating = mean(Rating)) 
```

.nunito[‚≠êÔ∏èTWO RULES:]
1. **Never save over raw data.** Keep the original data in a separate folder.
2. **Document everything.** `#` is your best friend.

### A WORD ON LEARNING R AND LOOKING FOR HELP
- We talked before about debugging and the importance of reading documentation.
--

- **Don‚Äôt pipe blindfolded !** Check that each command does what it‚Äôs expected to do. <br> *How is this command treating missing values?* (More on *defensive programming* on Friday)

--
- If things are not working out, check that you specified all the arguments you need and that they are appropriate. `?function()` is free!!

--
- Search online. Your questions have fore sure been asked before on ***stackoverflow.***
    - Learning how to Google/prompt is a skill in itself. 
    - If you can‚Äôt understand an error message, paste the error message on Google along with the name of your command.
    - ‚≠êÔ∏è Ask in the course website. I‚Äôll do my best to support you throughout this year.
- üíé **Check for typos.** 70% of the time this is the issue.

### HOMEWORK (1/2) 
üîî .nunito[**Due tomorrow before 11:15 **]. <br> Submit using this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/kGB7qVRf) and following the instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0XcZ-c_oF8). 

‚úÖÔ∏è Inspect the IMDB dataset [üîç`glimpse()` `table()`] and describe 5 issues we should solve in the data cleaning/tidying process that we haven‚Äôt addressed in this lecture. Write down the name of at least one function that would help for this. Google if you need! 

- The year variable is not numeric and has string characters. üîç`str_length()`, `str_sub()`, `as.numeric()`

‚úÖÔ∏è Are older movies better?

1) Fix the year variable. This can be done in multiple ways! Try with üîç`str_length()` and `str_sub()`

2) Create a variable that indicates whether a movie is older or more recent than the average year in the sample.

3) Create a table with the average rating by decade (start from the 50s).

‚úÖ  AI Reflection


Once you‚Äôve completed the coding part (or after at least 30 minutes of trying on your own), you may use an AI tool (like ChatGPT) to help you understand or refine your solution.
Then, write a short reflection (in your R script) answering the following questions:

1. What prompt did you give to the AI?
2. What kind of answer did it give you? Was it helpful? Why or why not?
3. How did you adapt or modify what the AI gave you, if at all?


üñçÔ∏è Don't forget to comment your code, describe what you are doing
